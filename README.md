# Digital-Image-Processing-Course-Design
This is: Course Design of DIP at UESTC

## Project 1: Adjust the grey release resolution of the images to and display them in the same figure window.


## Project 2: Superimpose different types of noise on the image and design a frequency domain low-pass filter to remove it.


## Project 3: An example is given to illustrate the application of top hat transform in image shadow correction. (The source image is "rice.bmp")


## Project 4: The Hough transform is used to detect straight lines in the image, and a series of constraints related to the transformation process (minimum length of line segments, etc.) can be superimposed by themselves. (The source image is "bank.bmp")


## Project 5: Perform threshold segmentation operation on the image and count the properties of each area block, and then mark the center and outer rectangle of each area. (Tip: If there are too many area blocks after segmentation, it is recommended to use the bwareaopen function under Matlab to filter out some area blocks)


## Project 6: Design a simple Matlab GUI interface program, which requires it to have the following functions: ① Open the file name setting dialog box when opening and saving images; ② When the entry in the drop-down menu is selected, the current selection is recorded in real time in the list box; ③ Interactive input of relevant parameters is realized through the edit box; ④ Display the input image and the processed result on the corresponding coordinate axis; ⑤ Contains toolbar and menu bar, when the component components under it are selected, corresponding image processing behavior must occur; ④ Modify the "Name" attribute of the figure window to its own name and student number; 0006 Compile the designed GUI program into an executable file in the form of ".exe".
